## Process

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox and CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I Learned

This project reinforced the following skills:

- Building a shopping cart from scratch using vanilla JavaScript
- Managing cart state with localStorage to persist cart data
- Dynamically updating UI elements based on user interactions

Hereâ€™s a sample of some JavaScript code I used:

```js
function addToCart(product) {
  // Logic to add product to cart
}

// Function to calculate total cart price
function calculateTotal() {
  return cart.reduce((total, item) => total + item.price * item.quantity, 0);
}
```

### Continued Development

Moving forward, I would like to continue improving my skills in:

- Optimizing JavaScript for better performance
- Improving accessibility with ARIA attributes
- Refining mobile responsiveness for more seamless cross-device experience

### Useful Resources

- [MDN Web Docs - localStorage](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Window/localStorage) - Helpful for storing and retrieving cart data.
- [CSS-Tricks - A Complete Guide to Flexbox](https://css-tricks.com/snippets/css/a-guide-to-flexbox/) - Great for structuring responsive layouts.
